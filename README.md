# ReeFi-Jelly 
This is a project developed at ETHGlobal Bogota Hackathon.

One of the biggest human-made problems is the destruction of ecosystem services and biodiversity all over the world, even though half of global GDP depends on them.

What if there was a decentralized way to tackle this worldwide problem and contribute to a regenerative economy?

This project is aimed at doing just that. By picking a project with the aim to restore and conserve it we facilitate financing it through NFTs and then have a smart contract to deploy the money in stages to the local stakeholders that are stewarding the restoration or conservation, for their work, and for education as well as for environmentally beneficial projects around it.

This way we make it possible that biodiversity and ecosystems as a public good are protected and economies around them are aligned to take care of them rather than extract and destroy them.
