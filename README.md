# Reefi-Jelly 
This is a project developed at ETHGlobal Bogota Hackathon.

One of the biggest human-made problems is the destruction of ecosystem services and biodiversity all over the world, even though half of global GDP depends on them.

What if there was a decentralized way to tackle this worldwide problem and contribute to a regenerative economy?

This project is aimed at doing just that. By picking a project with the aim to restore and conserve it we facilitate financing it through NFTs and then have a smart contract to deploy the money in stages to the local stakeholders that are stewarding the restoration or conservation, for their work, and for education as well as for environmentally beneficial projects around it.

This way we make it possible that biodiversity and ecosystems as a public good are protected and economies around them are aligned to take care of them rather than extract and destroy them.


# // Internal WIP // Prizes we are aiming for 

## Polygon
ü§ë $4,000 for best local LATAM public goods or Refi project(s) - Public goods are good. Solve a problem relevant to LATAM by building either a public good or a regenerative finance app. Explain how your hack will benefit the local community and how it could scale globally.

* should be public good: Coral Reef
* should be regenerative:
* education for fishermen in coral reef stewardship
* income for former fishermen
* income for 

## Ethereum Foundation
üèÜ Prize - Inclusion and tangible local impact
This prize is for two projects that clearly articulate a problem of inclusion (financial, political, social, or other), and then proposes a web3 solution that enables participation and representation for all humans. Special consideration for novel mechanisms of job creation or educational access.
üèÖ-$2,500 Designated for LATAM

*exclusion: the poorest people are the ones who suffer most from environmental degradation
*participation: local government and stewards get a say in what happens on thre reef and benefit from it as well
*job creation: stewardship, tourism and carbon sinking activities
